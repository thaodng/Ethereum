I'm sure it will help you.</p><p>I don't need to tell you that <strong>Programming and Blockchain Technologies are the most valuable technical skills to have right now. </strong>These fields are exploding withÂ  progress and new opportunities.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>About Videos Quality</strong></p><p><strong>Udemy uses Dynamic Adaptive Streaming for video delivery. </strong>That means that it tries to deliver videos at the highest <em>usable </em>quality for each specific user. </p><p><strong>From the experience of many students sometimes it fails and you'll see blurred videos.</strong> If you know you have a decent Internet connection, the best you can do is to try to set manually the resolution to 720p in Udemy web player (by default it's set to Auto). </p><p>This is <strong>NOT</strong> a course problem (each lecture is FullHD or HD quality), but an Internet slow connection or a Udemy technical issue. If the problem persists, please get in touch with me to see how we can solve it.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Just a quick tip about reviewing this course.</strong></p><p>Sometimes, Udemy asks for review and rating for the course very early. I think it's difficult to know about the course just by watching a couple of videos. Isn't it?</p><p><strong>Here's my request: </strong>Please take time to go through the course and once you get an idea, then please leave your honest review and rating.</p><p>And if you think there is something not clear <strong>please get in touch with me.</strong> I would love to hear from you about what is missing so that I can improve that area of the course and help you learn and grow in your career.</p><p><br></p><p>Let's keep moving!</p><p><br></p></p>
