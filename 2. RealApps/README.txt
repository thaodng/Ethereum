Starting with Solidity 0.5.0 there are some minor changes that are not backward compatible with older versions (0.4.x).

In the resource directory that contains all smart contracts developed in the course, you'll find 2 versions (.sol files): one that can be compiled by solidity 0.4.x 
and another that should be compiled by solidity versions greater than 0.5.0
If you use the Remix IDE, you can choose the compiler version in COMPILE TAB 

Exemple:
lottery-solidity-0.4.29.sol  -> should be compiled by solidity 0.4.29
lottery-solidity-0.5.0.sol  -> should be compiled by solidity 0.5.0 or greater
